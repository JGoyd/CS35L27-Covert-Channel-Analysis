Activation Sequence: I2S Bidirectional Capability

Between I2S writes at 0xE0817B and 0xE08590:
  - 1050 bytes between events
  - GPIO ops: 14 (SETB 0x34, CLR/SETB 0x32, 0x38, 0x2B, multiple toggles)
  - Final: SETB 0x38 at 0xE08593 — activation before I2S bidirectional write

After I2S bidirectional:
  - 4 GPIO ops within next 184 bytes
  - CLR 0x38 at 0xE08641 (possible “deactivation/cleanup”)
Pattern:
  1. Multiple GPIO toggles
  2. SETB 0x38 [activation]
  3. I2S bidirectional mode write
  4. Operation executes
  5. CLR 0x38 [cleanup]
  6. Return to normal I2S mode

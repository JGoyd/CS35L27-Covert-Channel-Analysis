Methodology and Analysis Environment

- Standalone static firmware analysis performed on iPhone 14 Pro Max, iOS 26.2, with no reference/clean device for comparison.
- Firmware memory extracted via device tools; analyzed with disassembler, code inspection, and event sequence reconstruction.
- Event/repetition frequencies, opcode sequences, and hardware control correlations derived from static code and configuration log review.
- Analysis assumes trace and binary logs/maps obtained directly from untampered firmware; limits noted for lack of reference/dynamic runtime output.
